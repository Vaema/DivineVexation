# IMPORTANT

This an important note to consider when contributing new utility classes.

Make sure the name of the file itself is different than the class name "DVUtils" and that it relates what this utility is for.

Any new utility classes MUST use the namespace DVMod ONLY for redundancy.
Additionally, often it should be the partial class name "DVUtils" unless if specifically told so.

Just simply use this if it's a partial class:
-> public static partial class DVUtils
